# Scalar

Runtime scalar conventions.

Runtime execution stays in `IEEE32Exec`/`Float`/`NeuralFloat`; each backend has a different proof
status relative to the spec layer.

Note on trust boundaries:
- Lean's `Float` is an *implementation* type; this repo does not prove that `Float` execution
  matches an IEEE-754 spec. Claims connecting `Float` execution to spec-level `ℝ` therefore cross a
  trusted runtime interface.
- `IEEE32Exec` is an executable bit-level IEEE-754 binary32 model; connecting it to Lean/runtime
  hardware float32 is out of scope (treat that bridge as trusted).
- For proof-relevant numeric execution, use the rounding model backends (`NeuralFloat` / `NF`),
  where per-op error bounds can be stated and composed.
- `NeuralFloat`/`NF` are formal *models* implemented in Lean. Relating them to real hardware
  floating-point (or Lean's `Float`) is a separate backend-correlation assumption, not a theorem in
  this module.
