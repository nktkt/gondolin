# Operator Correctness

Per-operator correctness lemmas for the IR → compiled runtime bridge.

This module is an index. Import it when you want the checked compiler-step lemmas without the
recursive semantic equivalence theorem.

The imported files are intentionally split by operator family. A single all-in-one proof file would
be hard to build and harder to review: Lean has to unfold compiler branches, normalize `Except`
control flow, compare dependent shapes, and prove that the compiled `GraphData` node appends the
same `DVal` as the IR evaluator. Keeping each family separate makes incremental builds and local
debugging much more pleasant.

The remaining proof engineering is to factor the repeated one-parent/two-parent boilerplate into
reusable helper lemmas and keep individual branches focused on their semantic equation.
