# Decision Trees (Small Spec-Only Baseline)

This file is small on purpose: it provides a pure decision tree datatype and an evaluator.
It is a standalone baseline and does not use the tensor/module APIs.

Why include it here?

- It serves as a non-neural "sanity check" baseline for experiments (e.g. mixed pipelines).
- The datatype is small enough to be convenient in proofs or examples without pulling in tensor
  machinery.

If you're thinking in the Python ecosystem: this is not an `nn.Module`-style component. It is
closer to a symbolic scikit-learn style decision tree, except we keep it fully pure and explicit.
