# Dropout as `NNModuleSpec`s (deterministic spec variants)

PyTorch's dropout is stochastic during training and becomes identity during evaluation.
In the spec layer we often want a deterministic, pure meaning that can be composed into models
and used in proofs without introducing randomness.

This file wraps the deterministic dropout specs from `NN/Spec/Layers/Dropout.lean` as
  `NNModuleSpec`s
so they can be used in `SpecChain` pipelines and carry export metadata.

Two variants are provided:

- `DropoutInferenceModuleSpec p`: a deterministic "scale by keep probability" variant.
- `DropoutMaskedModuleSpec p mask`: a deterministic "training-style" dropout that takes the mask
  explicitly (useful when you want to model a particular dropout pattern).

/-- Deterministic inference-time dropout wrapper.

This is a pure scaling op (`x ↦ (1 - p) * x`). It is a deterministic surrogate used in some spec
models rather than PyTorch's running training/eval state.

def DropoutInferenceModuleSpec {s : Shape} (p : α) : NNModuleSpec α s s :=
{ forward := fun x => dropoutInferenceSpec (α := α) (s := s) p x
  kind := "DropoutInference"
  export_func := {
    -- Keep this as a plain string (no `ToString α` requirement).
    toPyTorch := "DropoutInference(p=...)"
    dimensions := (0, 0)
  } }

/-- Deterministic masked dropout wrapper (mask is captured as data).

This matches the usual training-time dropout structure with the mask made explicit instead of
sampled. The forward uses the same scaling and epsilon-protection as `dropout_masked_spec`.

def DropoutMaskedModuleSpec {s : Shape} (p : α) (mask : Tensor Bool s) : NNModuleSpec α s s :=
{ forward := fun x => dropoutMaskedSpec (α := α) (s := s) p mask x

    -- Keep this as a plain string (no `ToString α` requirement).
