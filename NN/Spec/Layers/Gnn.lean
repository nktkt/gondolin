# Graph neural network layers (spec layer)

We provide a couple of small, standard GNN building blocks that show up in lots of papers and
PyTorch GNN libraries:

- a basic "message passing / neighbor aggregation" primitive, and
- a GCN-style graph convolution layer.

## Message passing (the common core idea)

Most GNN layers have the same shape of computation:

- aggregate neighbor features using the graph structure, then
- optionally apply a learnable transformation and a nonlinearity.

In this file the aggregation step is written with a matrix `A : (n×n)`:

`Agg(A, H) = A · H`.

This captures many common conventions:

- if `A` is the raw adjacency, you are summing neighbors,
- if `A` is normalized (e.g. `D^{-1/2} (A + I) D^{-1/2}`), you are doing the "GCN normalization"
  flavor,
- if `A` includes edge weights, you are doing a weighted sum.

## GCN layer (one very common choice)

We model a GCN-style layer as:

  `H' = A · H · W + b`

where:
- `A : (n×n)` is an adjacency-like matrix (often normalized, and often with self-loops),
- `H : (n×inDim)` are node features,
- `W : (inDim×outDim)` and `b : outDim` are trainable parameters.

PyTorch mental picture:

- This is the algebraic core of what libraries like PyTorch Geometric call `GCNConv` once you pick
  a concrete choice of `A` (raw adjacency, `D^{-1/2} (A + I) D^{-1/2}`, etc.) and batch conventions.

Why only these two right now:

- GCN + plain aggregation are enough to cover a lot of examples and give us something we can
  reason about cleanly.
- We do plan to add other families (GraphSAGE, GAT, generic MPNNs). Those require more choices
  (per-edge features, masking/batching conventions, and tie-ins to attention-style ops), so we want
  to introduce them carefully instead of piling on half-finished variants.

/-- Parameters/data for a single GCN-style layer.

We bundle `A` with the layer because many code paths treat `A` as a fixed input per graph, while
others treat it as a parameter (e.g. learned normalization). Keeping it in the record makes both
uses explicit.

Notes:

- The bias `b` is broadcast across the `n` nodes (row-wise add).

## Gradients

For the simple GCN-style layer

`Y = A · X · W + b`

the reverse-mode derivatives are the standard matrix calculus ones:

- `dW = (A·X)ᵀ · dY`
- `db = Σᵢ dYᵢ` (sum across the node axis)
- `dX = Aᵀ · (dY · Wᵀ)`
- `dA = (dY · Wᵀ) · Xᵀ`

We include `dA` because in some setups the adjacency/normalization is also:

- treated as an input you want sensitivities for, or
- treated as a parameter (e.g. learned edge weights / learned normalization).
