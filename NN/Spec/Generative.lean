# Spec generative models

Umbrella import for generative-model specification utilities.

The diffusion chapter defines noising processes, reverse samplers, and PF-ODE-style dynamics. The
latent chapter provides reusable VAE/VQ-VAE-style latent helpers. Both are written as pure
scalar-polymorphic specs so runtime and proof layers can share the same equations.
