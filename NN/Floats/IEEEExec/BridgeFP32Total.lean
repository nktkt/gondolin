# BridgeFP32Total

“Total” bridge theorems combining:

- `IEEE32Exec`'s proved NaN/Inf propagation rules, and
- the `FP32`-on-`ℝ` refinement theorems for the finite/no-overflow branch (`BridgeFP32.lean`).

The key end-user view is `toReal?`:
- `toReal? x = none` for NaN/Inf,
- `toReal? x = some r` for finite values, with `r : ℝ`.

In most of Gondlin, the finite path is treated as real arithmetic + float32 rounding while
special-value behavior is kept explicit. This file packages that split in one place.

The per-op lemmas are phrased in the style:

`toReal? (op …) = if isFinite (op …) then some (fp32Round …) else none`.

That makes the trust boundary readable at the call site: the `if` is exactly where NaN/Inf (or
overflow-to-Inf) can occur.
