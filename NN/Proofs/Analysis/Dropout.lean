# Dropout analysis properties

Gondolin splits stochastic training-mode dropout into two pieces:

- a mask/seed producer, treated as non-differentiated data in autograd proofs, and
- a deterministic tensor map once the mask or inference probability is fixed.

This file records small spec-level identities for the deterministic inference map. The fixed-mask
training-mode derivative infrastructure lives with the autograd tape-node proofs.

Overfitting”.

Mapping the identity function over a tensor is the identity.

This is private because the public dropout theorem below is the intended reusable fact; if we need a
general tensor-map identity elsewhere, it should move to the tensor proof library rather than stay
hidden in the dropout file.

Deterministic dropout inference scaling is the identity when `p = 0`.

Inference dropout multiplies activations by the keep/dropout scaling factor from the spec. At zero
dropout probability that factor is `1`, so the whole tensor is unchanged.
