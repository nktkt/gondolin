# Attention Model Proofs

This is the proof-facing umbrella for attention model facts.

The executable/spec definitions live under `NN.Spec.Layers.Attention`. This module collects theorems
about those definitions: exact causal-mask semantics, attention-weight normalization, and
permutation equivariance of self-attention without positional encodings.

Import this file when downstream proofs need the attention theorem bundle. Import the spec module
directly when you only need the definitions.
