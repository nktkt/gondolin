# Attention weights sum to 1 (spec layer, `ℝ`)

For unmasked scaled dot-product attention, the attention weights are computed by applying
`Activation.softmax_spec` row-wise to the scaled score matrix.

This file records the normalization theorem that each row of those unmasked weights sums to `1`.
Masked attention uses hard-mask semantics; its normalization theorem needs the additional
well-formedness assumption that each row admits at least one key.

/--
In unmasked scaled dot-product attention, each query row of the attention-weight matrix sums to `1`.

This is purely a property of `softmax_spec`; it does not depend on the particular choice of scores,
or scaling.
