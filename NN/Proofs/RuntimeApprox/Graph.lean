# Runtime Approximation Graphs

Backend-independent composition theorems for approximation bounds over typed SSA/tape graphs.

The leaf modules define forward graph composition, reverse-mode/backward graph composition, and the
bridge from proof-level graphs to the executable autograd-algebra `GraphData` representation.
Concrete numeric backends instantiate these graph theorems by supplying local per-op approximation
lemmas.
