# NF Runtime Approximation Backend

Proof-relevant rounded tensor/operator approximation for `NF`.

`NF` wraps real values and inserts an explicit `neural_round` step after primitive arithmetic. The
modules collected here prove local bounds for elementwise ops, reductions, shape-only ops, linear
algebra, Conv2D forward/backward, and graph-level end-to-end execution.

File roles:
- `Ops`: scalar and elementwise tensor bounds, plus primitive `FwdNode` constructors.
- `Linalg`: matrix/vector and matrix/matrix multiplication bounds.
- `ReductionOps`: row/column reductions used by normalization and attention.
- `ShapeOps`: value-preserving tensor rearrangements such as replication/broadcasting.
- `BackwardOps`: VJP bounds and `RevNode` constructors for reverse-mode composition.
- `Conv`, `ConvForward`, `ConvBackward`: Conv2D shared error algebra plus forward/backward bounds.
- `EndToEnd`: bridge from proof-level `RevGraph` theorems to executable `GraphData`.
- `SoftmaxAxis`: documentation separating scalar softmax/logistic bounds from vector-valued
  vector-valued axis softmax bounds.
- `Utils`: shared list-fold and tensor approximation helpers.

This is the backend we can reason about inside Lean. Hardware CUDA/IEEE execution remains an
implementation trust boundary unless it is connected to this model by a separately proved or
certified semantics.
