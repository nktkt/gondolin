# NF Shape Operators

NF (rounded) backend: approximation lemmas for shape-only tensor operators.

These operators do not perform arithmetic on scalars (they only permute/replicate entries), so
they preserve existing `approxT` error bounds.

That distinction matters: shape-only ops should not introduce extra rounding error. Their proofs
are mostly transport/indexing arguments rather than numerical analysis.

## PyTorch correspondence / citations
These are the proof analogues of “view-like”/index-rearrangement ops in PyTorch which do not change
floating-point values, only their arrangement:
