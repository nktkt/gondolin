# Runtime Approximation Scale Bounds

Optional scale propagation for runtime-approximation proofs.

Plain approximation lemmas track absolute error budgets. This layer additionally tracks
nonnegative bounds on tensor magnitudes, usually `‖x‖∞ ≤ B`, so absolute error statements can be
reported as more readable absolute/relative tolerances.
