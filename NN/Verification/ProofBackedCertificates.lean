# Certificate theorem examples

Most files in this directory are runnable checkers: they parse an artifact, recompute the relevant
bounds, and reject the artifact if it disagrees with Lean. This file shows the complementary
theorem-backed layer. The public theorems below are the bridge from “the checker accepted this
certificate” to “the represented graph semantics is enclosed.”

The split is deliberate:

- executable examples are fast, concrete, and good for interoperability with JSON artifacts;
- theorem-backed results explain what those checks mean mathematically once their hypotheses are
  discharged for a supported graph and certificate format.

In other words, a JSON checker answers "does this artifact match Lean recomputation?" The theorem
handles below answer the stronger question: "assuming the local checker hypotheses, what semantic
fact follows?"
