# Sequence Examples (Gondlin)

This folder contains the runnable sequence model examples.

If you only want the main tutorials:

- `CharGpt.lean` (`lake exe gondlin chargpt ...`): the minGPT style character GPT walkthrough.
- `Gpt2.lean` (`lake exe gondlin gpt2 ...`): a small byte level GPT-2 style causal Transformer.
- `Gpt2Saved.lean` (`lake exe gondlin gpt2_saved ...`): load weights saved by `gpt2` and sample.
- `TextGpt2.lean` (`lake exe gondlin text_gpt2 ...`): CUDA only corpus trainer, with byte level
  tokens or GPT-2 BPE.
- `Mamba.lean` (`lake exe gondlin mamba ...`): compact text training for the Mamba-style model.

Why there are multiple GPT like files:

- They use different *tokenizers* and *intended scales*.
- `chargpt` is intentionally the simplest educational path (single file corpus, alphabet tokenizer).
- `gpt2` is a small transformer you can step through and modify locally.
- `text_gpt2` is the "trainer interface" for larger corpora and optional GPT-2 BPE.

Other sequence demos are here too (RNN/LSTM layer smoke tests, a transformer block, and the
`gpt_adder` curriculum). Supervised time series forecasting lives in
`NN/Examples/Models/Supervised/LstmRegression.lean`, even though it uses an LSTM internally.
