# BugZoo: shape and broadcasting boundaries

This file records the Gondolin response to a very common bug class: tensor shape mistakes that
would normally appear only at runtime, or worse, silently broadcast to the wrong expression.

The empirical motivation is concrete. Wu, Shen, and Chen build SFData, a corpus of 146 crashing
tensor-shape bugs, and use missing batch dimensions as a representative pattern:

- Wu, Shen, and Chen, “Detecting Tensor Shape Faults in Deep Learning Systems”, ISSTA 2022.
  https://doi.org/10.1145/3533767.3534383

Wang et al. also describe numerical bugs where a missing `keep_dims=True` changes a reduction shape;
NumPy/PyTorch-style broadcasting then makes a later expression typecheck while computing the wrong
loss:

- Wang et al., “An Empirical Study on Numerical Bugs in Deep Learning Programs”, ASE NIER 2022.
  https://conf.researchr.org/details/ase-2022/ase-2022-nier-track/18/An-Empirical-Study-on-Numerical-Bugs-in-Deep-Learning-Programs

Gondolin makes this case explicit: ordinary elementwise ops require the same shape, and
broadcasting requires `Shape.CanBroadcastTo` evidence. The examples below show the intended
workflow. A missing batch dimension is not silently accepted; we write the singleton batch
insertion. A reduced vector is not silently expanded back into a matrix; we carry the broadcast
proof.

Bug-shaped PyTorch sketch:

```python
# Crashes or silently changes later code depending on where it appears:
image = torch.randn(100, 100, 3)
model(image)          # model expected [1, 100, 100, 3]

# Easy to miss: reduction drops a dimension, then a later op broadcasts it back.
row_sum = x.sum(dim=0)          # [3], not [1, 3]
loss = ((x - row_sum) ** 2).sum()
```

Gondolin equivalent:

```lean
def batched := addSingletonBatch image
def row := reduceRows x
def explicit := broadcastRowToMatrix row
```

The important part is not the syntax; it is that the shape change and broadcast are named terms
with types and proof evidence.

Insert an explicit singleton batch dimension.

This is the Gondolin version of the fix for the classic “forgot the batch axis” bug: we do not let
`Tensor α [100,100,3]` masquerade as `Tensor α [1,100,100,3]`; the user has to name the reshape.

/--
Evidence that a row vector can be broadcast back across the outer dimension of a `2 × 3` matrix.

This is exactly the piece Gondolin wants users and proof scripts to make visible: if a reduction
dropped a dimension, any later expansion is an explicit broadcast, not an accidental side effect.
