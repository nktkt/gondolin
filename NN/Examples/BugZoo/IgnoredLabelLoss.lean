# BugZoo: ignored labels are a reduction contract

PyTorch issue #75181 reported `CrossEntropyLoss(ignore_index=...)` returning `nan` for an all-
ignored target case:

https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/75181

The formal lesson is not "Gondlin has PyTorch's full label-indexed loss kernel." It is simpler:
ignored labels should be represented as an explicit contribution mask, and the empty-active-label
reduction policy should be stated in the spec rather than left as backend behavior.

/--
One explicit empty-reduction policy: divide by an epsilon-shifted active count.

Real training code may choose a different policy, such as returning zero for an empty batch. The
important thing is that the policy is named and checkable instead of hidden inside a backend loss
kernel.
