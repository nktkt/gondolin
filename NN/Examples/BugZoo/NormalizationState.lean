# BugZoo: normalization state and BatchNorm contracts

BatchNorm is a small formula with a surprisingly large bug surface. Cross-backend testing work
found real library bugs around normalization formulas and backend conventions, including epsilon
placement in BatchNorm. Model-generation testing also found BatchNormalization failures involving
wrong moving statistics and NaN-producing outputs.

  Libraries", ICSE 2019.

  Covariate Shift", ICML 2015.

Gondlin addresses this class in two layers:
- the spec formula is explicit, so epsilon placement is not hidden in backend code;
- inference-time running statistics are explicit inputs, so train/eval state boundaries become part
  of the checked object rather than ambient mutable framework state.

/--
The buggy BatchNorm pattern reported by cross-backend testing is easy to state:
putting epsilon outside the square root changes the formula from

`(x - μ) / sqrt(σ² + ε)`

to

`(x - μ) / (sqrt(σ²) + ε)`.

We keep this definition as the "bad PyTorch-like code" analogue for documentation and regression
tests. Gondlin's actual `normalizeCore` does not use this expression.

def wrongEpsilonOutsideSqrt (x mean variance gamma beta epsilon : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ((x - mean) / (Real.sqrt variance + epsilon)) * gamma + beta

/--
The intended scalar BatchNorm expression. This mirrors the public Gondlin normalization spec:
epsilon is added to the variance before the square root.
-/
def correctEpsilonInsideSqrt (x mean variance gamma beta epsilon : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ((x - mean) / Real.sqrt (variance + epsilon)) * gamma + beta

/--
Spec-level BatchNorm uses epsilon inside the variance term.

There is one extra implementation detail worth making explicit: `sqrtSpec` is total, so it computes
`sqrt (max (variance + epsilon) 0)`. On the usual BatchNorm path, variance is nonnegative and
epsilon is positive, so this is the same mathematical formula as `sqrt (variance + epsilon)`.

/--
Running statistics are part of the BatchNorm inference contract.

This is the boundary that catches a common state bug: using stale or unintended moving statistics
cannot be invisible inside Gondlin, because the exact `runningMean` and `runningVar` tensors are
arguments to the spec.

/--
Inference-time BatchNorm is affine once running statistics are fixed.

This re-exports the analysis theorem used by optimizers and verifiers: the checked stateful
inference spec can be folded into a pointwise affine map, but only after the running statistics are
made explicit.
