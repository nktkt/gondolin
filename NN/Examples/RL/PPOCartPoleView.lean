# PPO CartPole Artifacts

This file visualizes the training curve produced by
`NN/Examples/Models/RL/PPOCartPole.lean` (`lake exe gondolin ppo_cartpole`).

The executable trainer stays in `Examples/Models`; this file is only the editor-side artifact
viewer. That split keeps PPO training code in one place and avoids a duplicate "RL examples" model
zoo.

Workflow:
1. Run:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user 'gymnasium>=1.0'
lake exe gondolin ppo_cartpole
lake build -R -K cuda=true && lake exe gondolin ppo_cartpole --cuda
```

2. Put the cursor on the command below in an editor. The infoview will render the saved log.

Notes:
- The executable writes `data/rl/ppo_cartpole_trainlog.json` by default (override with `--log`).
- This viewer is pure: if the file is missing, it shows an error panel instead of failing to build.
