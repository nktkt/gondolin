# Verification entrypoint

This is the public umbrella import for Gondolin’s verification infrastructure: JSON utilities,
certificate formats, ODE/PINN-style checkers, proof-backed certificate soundness, and the verified
Gondolin-to-IR forward compiler bridge.

We keep one verification entrypoint on purpose. The verified compiler bridge is imported here
through the naming-friendly `NN.Verification.Gondolin.Verified` API, so users do not have to choose
between separate “proved” and “verified” umbrellas.

Runnable CLIs stay out of this umbrella. If you want a command-line tool, import
the registry explicitly (for example `NN.Verification.CLI`).

Proof-backed certificate workflows enter here too. Executable examples can parse JSON artifacts and
recompute bounds inside Lean; theorem-level credit comes from the imported CROWN/LiRPA soundness
development, where locally valid certificates are connected to Lean graph semantics.
