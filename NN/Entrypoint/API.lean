# API entrypoint

This entrypoint exists mainly for symmetry with the other curated `NN.Entrypoint.*` umbrellas.
It re-exports the primary user-facing facade `NN.API.Public`.

Most users should still prefer `import NN`; use this module when you want only the public
PyTorch-shaped API without the broader library umbrella.
