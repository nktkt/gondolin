# NN/Entrypoint

This directory contains curated umbrella imports for the major Gondlin subsystems.

Use these modules when you want one stable import for a subsystem without depending on the internal
file layout.

Examples:

* `NN/Entrypoint/Spec.lean` (pure spec layer)
* `NN/Entrypoint/Runtime.lean` (runtime execution layer)
* `NN/Entrypoint/IR.lean` (op-tagged graph IR)
* `NN/Entrypoint/Verification.lean` (verification infrastructure)
* `NN/Entrypoint/Proofs.lean` (proof library umbrella)

Most users should prefer `import NN` or `import NN.API.Public` rather than importing entrypoints
directly.
