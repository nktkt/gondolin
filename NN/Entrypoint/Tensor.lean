# Tensor entrypoint

Curated umbrella import for Gondlin's core tensor/shape API.

This is the stable subsystem import path for tensor literals, shape aliases, dynamic tensors, and
small executable tensor helpers. `NN.Tensor.API` remains the implementation leaf; downstream users
should prefer either `NN.Library` for the broad public surface or `NN.Entrypoint.Tensor` for just
the tensor layer.
