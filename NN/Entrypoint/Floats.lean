# Floats entrypoint

This is the “all floating-point semantics in one import” entrypoint:

- proof-oriented real-valued models (`FP32`, `NeuralFloat`),
- the executable bit-level model (`IEEEExec`),
- interval/enclosure utilities (`Interval`),
- and the external Arb oracle integration (`Arb`),
- and the shared error-bound vocabulary used across the library.

This module is the chapter boundary for the floating-point surface. It imports the focused
`NN.Floats.*` subsystems directly so downstream users have one stable entrypoint.
