# Lyapunov oracle

We isolate the single oracle assumption used by Gondlin's Lyapunov/CROWN workflow:
`crown_oracle`.

Everything else in the Lyapunov verification workflow should reduce to ordinary theorems that *depend*
on this axiom, but do not introduce additional axioms.

Trust-boundary policy:
- Repo linting allowlists `axiom crown_oracle` only in this file.
- Downstream modules should `import NN.MLTheory.CROWN.Lyapunov.Oracle` (directly or via
  `NN.MLTheory.CROWN.Lyapunov.Verification`) rather than defining new trusted axioms.

References:
- Lyapunov stability is the classical certificate pattern: prove `V > 0` and `Vdot < 0` on a
  region.
- The numeric bound producer is CROWN-style affine/interval propagation; see Zhang et al. (CROWN,
  NeurIPS 2018) and Xu et al. (auto_LiRPA/α-CROWN).

/--
Opaque witness produced by an external checker that is trusted by project policy for this workflow.
It attests that the numeric bounds packaged in `cert` are sound for the given `lyap`.

This witness is intentionally *not* constructible inside Lean. It represents an external
artifact/checker run (e.g. α/β-CROWN) that we treat as a trust boundary.

Oracle axiom: if the trusted external witness is supplied for a certificate, then the certificate
bounds hold.

This is the only trusted axiom for the Lyapunov oracle approach.
