# CROWN Graph

Graph-based LiRPA scaffolding (IBP + CROWN-style affine bounds).

This file is the "graph engine" counterpart to `NN.MLTheory.CROWN.Core`:
- `core` defines the scalar/box/affine primitives (`Box`, `AffineVec`, `IBP.linear`),
- `graph` lifts those primitives to arbitrary tensor DAGs (`NN.IR.Graph`).

What this module is for:
- Representing computation graphs over typed tensors.
- Propagating *interval* bounds forward (IBP).
- Propagating *affine* bounds (CROWN/DeepPoly style) w.r.t. a designated input node.
- Optionally running objective-dependent backward passes for tighter bounds.

Design notes:
- We store *flattened* bounds (`FlatBox`, `FlatAffine*`) so we can reuse `AffineVec` unchanged.
- Sequence models are represented by unrolling recurrent cells into a DAG (shared parameters,
  repeated ops).
- Transformer-style models rely on matmul/softmax/elementwise ops; relaxations are added
  incrementally.

while affine CROWN passes additionally fill `aff?`.

Coverage map for propagation rules:

Forward (IBP):
- add/sub: interval add/sub componentwise
- mul_elem: McCormick envelopes for elementwise product
- matmul/linear/conv2d: interval matrix multiplication as in `IBP.linear`/conv IBP
- relu/tanh/sigmoid/exp/log: elementwise monotone bounds (use activation-specific rules)
- softmax/layernorm: conservative last-axis interval bounds

Backward (CROWN):
- relu/tanh/sigmoid: per-neuron linear relaxations (like ReLU; tanh/sigmoid need convex hull)
- matmul/linear/conv2d: compose affine forms via matrix multiplication
- mul_elem: bilinear relaxation via McCormick (introduces additional linear terms)
- softmax/layernorm/mul_elem: conservative affine enclosures in the executable engine

Sequence models (RNN/GRU/LSTM):
- Unroll time steps as repeated nodes; gates are linear → nonlinearity → elementwise product
- Apply rules above for tanh/sigmoid and elementwise products.

Transformers:
- Provide ops for Q,K,V projections (linear), attention scores (matmul), softmax, and output matmul.
- Optional: bound sharing across heads; efficient batched propagation.
