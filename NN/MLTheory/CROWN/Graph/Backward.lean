# CROWN Graph Backward Objective API

Compatibility façade for the objective-dependent backward CROWN functions. The implementation lives
with the forward affine engine in `Graph/Engine`, because the backward pass reuses the same private
affine-transfer helpers. Keeping this module lets downstream code import the backward chapter by
name without exposing those helpers as public API.
