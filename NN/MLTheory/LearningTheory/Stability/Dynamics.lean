# Stability of dynamical systems

This entrypoint collects the discrete-time stability layer for maps of the form
`x_{t+1} = f x_t` and input-driven systems `x_{t+1} = f x_t u_t`.

The spec file states the mathematical predicates: Lyapunov stability, asymptotic stability,
exponential stability, input-to-state stability, BIBO stability, incremental stability, practical
stability, finite-time stability, and data/model stability. The runtime file provides `Float`
diagnostics for concrete systems. As with robustness, the diagnostic layer is empirical unless a
separate theorem connects it to a certified bound.
