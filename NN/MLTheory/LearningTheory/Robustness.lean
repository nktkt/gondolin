# Robustness

This entrypoint pairs the two layers of Gondolin's robustness vocabulary:

- `Robustness.Spec` gives scalar-polymorphic definitions over shape-indexed tensors: tensor norms,
  distances, adversarial robustness, certified robustness, Lipschitz continuity, and contractions.
- `Robustness.Runtime` specializes those definitions to `Float` and provides finite, empirical
  diagnostics for examples and command-line checks.

We keep these layers separate on purpose. The spec layer is the mathematical language used by proof
developments; the runtime layer computes observed quantities from finite samples and does not claim
certification by itself.
