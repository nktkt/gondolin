# Diffusion theory

This entrypoint collects the diffusion-theory facts that connect Gondolin's executable sampler
specifications to the mathematical language used in diffusion and score-based generative modeling.

This entrypoint contains two stable pieces of the theory surface:
- `ForwardGaussian`: a mathlib-backed result showing that affine forward noising of a standard
  Gaussian remains Gaussian.
- `Samplers`: proved boundary, dynamics-adapter, and Euler-stability facts for DDPM, DDIM, and
  probability-flow samplers.

Probabilistic claims and executable sampler claims stay separate. The spec layer defines the noising
and reverse-update functions; this theory layer records the mathematical facts we can prove cleanly
about those definitions.
