# Hopfield-network proofs

This entrypoint collects the discrete Hopfield proof development:

- Boolean state bookkeeping;
- the classical symmetric-zero-diagonal energy function;
- one-coordinate update energy monotonicity;
- full-sweep progress; and
- convergence to a fixed point within a finite bound.

The proofs follow the standard Lyapunov-energy analysis of Hopfield networks, stated over
Gondolin's spec-level model so the theorem layer and model layer share one semantics.
