# Robustness verification proofs

This entrypoint collects proof-level links between robustness specifications and analytic
certificates. The files underneath prove:

- Lipschitz continuity implies adversarial robustness;
- logit margins plus output perturbation bounds preserve the `argmax` classifier; and
- basic MLP/ReLU Lipschitz lemmas used by certified-robustness statements.

The executable verifiers live elsewhere; this chapter supplies the mathematical statements that
make those certificates meaningful.
