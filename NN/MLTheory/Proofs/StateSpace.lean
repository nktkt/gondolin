# State-space model proofs

This entrypoint collects the proof layer for S4/Mamba-style state-space sequence models. We prove
two complementary facts:

- affine selective scan summaries compose associatively and agree with left-to-right recurrence;
- recurrent S4/Mamba runners are prefix-causal, so appending future tokens cannot change outputs
  already emitted for a prefix.

The CUDA and runtime implementations are free to use efficient scan schedules, but their semantic
target is the spec-level recurrence captured here.
