# Approximation proofs

This entrypoint collects Gondolin's approximation-theory proof chapter. We separate the two main
threads while keeping them importable together:

- constructive ReLU universal approximation over real semantics, with quantitative and
  finite-precision variants; and
- exact interval semantics for rounded binary32 targets.

Both threads expose the mathematical assumptions and numerical side conditions explicitly rather
than burying them inside runtime behavior.
