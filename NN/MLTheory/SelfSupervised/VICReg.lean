# VICReg and Barlow-Twins style collapse guards

This file formalizes the parts of recent redundancy-reduction SSL objectives that are cleanly
checkable without importing probability, asymptotics, or differentiable optimization theory.

Paper anchors:
- VICReg, “Variance-Invariance-Covariance Regularization for Self-Supervised Learning”
  (Bardes, Ponce, LeCun, 2021), arXiv:2105.04906.  VICReg combines an invariance loss between two
  views with variance and covariance regularizers; the variance term explicitly discourages
  collapsed embeddings by penalizing coordinates whose standard deviation falls below a threshold.
- Barlow Twins, “Self-Supervised Learning via Redundancy Reduction” (Zbontar et al., ICML 2021),
  arXiv:2103.03230.  Barlow Twins pushes the empirical cross-correlation matrix between two views
  toward the identity: diagonal entries should be one, off-diagonal entries should be zero.

The Lean statements below intentionally prove finite-objective facts, not full learning guarantees:
- a fully collapsed variance vector pays a positive VICReg variance penalty;
- an identity correlation summary has zero Barlow-style redundancy loss;
- a collapsed diagonal entry pays positive redundancy penalty.

The scalar quantities are natural numbers here. Runtime examples can use floating-point losses; the
theory captures the algebraic shape of the collapse guard without importing numerical analysis.

Hinge penalty for a variance floor: `max(0, gamma - v)`, written over `Nat`.

This is the discrete analogue of the VICReg variance hinge.  In the floating-point objective, `v`
would be a per-coordinate standard deviation; in this finite formalization it is an already-computed
nonnegative summary.

A compact VICReg-style objective over already-computed nonnegative summary terms.

`invariance`, `variance`, and `covariance` are summaries; this file does not claim to formalize the
statistical estimator used to produce them.

Collapsed coordinates (`variance = 0`) pay exactly `d * gamma`.

This is the direct anti-collapse fact: if every coordinate has zero variance, the variance floor
does not silently accept it.

/-! ## Barlow/VICReg-style redundancy penalties -/

/--
Penalty for a diagonal cross-correlation entry that should be one.

The `Nat` version is an absolute-deviation hinge around `1`.  The Barlow Twins paper uses squared
floating-point deviations, but both objectives share the key finite property proved below: diagonal
value `1` is free, while collapsed diagonal value `0` is not.

/--
Barlow-style redundancy-reduction objective over already-computed diagonal and off-diagonal
correlation summaries.

Over `Nat`, the diagonal penalty is zero at `1`; the off-diagonal penalty is zero at `0`. Runtime
versions can use squared floating-point deviations.
