# Learning theory

This is the curated entrypoint for Gondolin's learning-theory layer. We group the files here around
three themes:

- robustness specifications and executable Float diagnostics;
- algorithmic stability definitions, dynamics stability, and a fully proved 1D ridge-regression
  stability theorem;
- differential privacy definitions and closure lemmas.

The files keep theorem statements explicit about their level. Specification files define
`Prop`-level notions; runtime files compute finite diagnostics; worked examples such as ridge
regression prove concrete bounds with explicit assumptions.
